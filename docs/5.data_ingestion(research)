# In research/data_ingestion :

%pwd : project working directory
---> current directory we are  working on.

# To Access the element outside the directory we have to go back
os.chdir("../") : chdir -->change directory
"../" : gone back 1 folder




2. Update config.yaml
 
 artifacts_root :artifcats 
 
 i.e defining our artifcats that will create an artifact folder and the folder will be storing our data(from components,other folders.).




 3. Creating data related configuration
 If we want to use some path/url and need to use we can store in config.yaml file and from here we can read it 
 
 if we want to change the directory path / add folder we can simply do it from changing the yaml file .
 it will reflect the change in whole code.

 4. Update params.yaml : but in this case we don't have any  paramas
 therfore we require whenever we want model trainer configuration.

 5. Update Entity : Entity is the return type of a function.
 For this we use dataclasses, 

 # define dataclass and inside that give parameter (frozen=True) and inside dacorator define class DataIngestion
@dataclass(frozen=True) # inside data class we can mention our varibles , and what is the type of varible
class DataIngestionConfig:
    root_dir: Path # variable : type of varibale is Path
    source_URL: str
    local_data_file:Path
    unzip_dir:Path

if we call anyone this they will return their path.


6. Update the config mananger in src : but we are not doing it in src we are doing in notebook experiment so writing code there only.

Importing all the constants , creating constant : int components/constanst we define our constants

What are our constants ?

Constant are : here we only want to return config.yaml and params.ml because we want to read it. To read config.yaml file we need the path 
as the path inside yaml file won't be changing and hence it is constant so to use again and again.

Inside constructor file of src/constans : we will read the file and return all the content inside it .
