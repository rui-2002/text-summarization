1. writing setup.py (it initializes our readme file) : look for constructor in all the files and install it as local package for every folder.


we can also publish this as a package in pypi
In this we are providing

to install requiremets from here make sure you add -e . at last





2. Setting up logging file

# created dir/folder name docs and inside it create a file runnig_log.log file
os.makedirs(log_dir,exist_ok=True) # it creates log directory and doesn't create again. if already there


# creating our own custom logger.

logging.FileHandler(log_filepath), # it will log inside logging txt file
logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)  # it will show loggings in terminal
