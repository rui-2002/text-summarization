# Before this we have setup up our logging file in src/logging




# Setting up utilis (files that are commonly used /commonly used functions):
1. Imported the modules
2. read_yml method to read yml file and return its content;
3. create_directories (method ) used to created directories eg for data ingestion,training or creating other folder.


@ensure_annotations: (it is a decorator) :

def get_product(x:int ,y:int) -> int: # -> int: this is return type of fn
    return x * y
get_product(x=2,y=5)
get_product(x=2,y="4")
from ensure import ensure_annotations
@ensure_annotations
def get_product(x:int ,y:int)->int:
    return x*y
get_product(x=2,y=5)
get_product(x=2,y="5") # bymistake put string instead of int (normally it gives 55) so to stop this misclassification
# we use @ensure_annotations


# suppose our function/code run eventhough with a mistake (it can cause problem/wrong data output)
therfore, this decorator gives error .



# returning yml file as configbox output / configbox type:
configbox help us to get values instead of list : we can use .
eg : dictionay.key (normally it would give error) we have to pass it in configbox
eg : ConfigBox(dictionay)  
eg : dictionay.key : we can get values easily 


from box import ConfigBox
d={"key":"value","key1":"value1"}
d['key']
#instead of list i want to acces it like this 
d.key
# this gives us error but if we want to access like that we use configbox
d=ConfigBox(d)
d.key1
